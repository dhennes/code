# Beginner's Guide to Reinforcement Learning

## OpenAI Gym

We will use the OpenAI Gym toolkit to explore some of the aspects of *reinforcement learning* and program our first *learning agent*. Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. You can learn more about it here: https://gym.openai.com/docs/

## Prerequisits
- some basic knowledge of Python
- a Python >=2.7 or Python 3 installation (e.g., via Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- Jupyter Notebook (comes with Anaconda)
- `pip` (to install dependencies)

## Installation

- you need to install **OpenAI Gym** (install via PyPI recommended)  
    https://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation    

```sh
pip install gym
